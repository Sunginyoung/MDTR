## Multi-dimensional Transcriptome Ruler
* Multi-dimenisonal transcriptome ruler (MDTR) provides measurements of the degree of dysregulation in gene expression data at the transcriptome level for five hepatotoxicity mechanisms.
  Five hepatotoxicity mechanisms
  * Oxidative stress
  * Immunological response
  * Altered lipid metabolism
  * Mitochondrial dysfunction
  * Bile acids accumulation
* The measured values are visualized through radar chart.
* MDTR is also accessible on the website: http://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/MDTR
