- Multi-dimenisonal transcriptome ruler (MDTR) provides measurements of the degree of dysregulation in gene expression data at the transcriptome level for five hepatotoxicity mechanisms.
- The measured values are visualized through radar chart.
- MDTR is also accessible on the website: http://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/MDTR

## Istallation
`MDTR.py` is implemented in with [Python](https://www.python.org/) libraries. Belows are requirements for `MDTR.py`.
